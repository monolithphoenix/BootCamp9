Create contact book using React and Redux.
"Add contact" button in list triggers scaling+opacity animation of popup form.
All buttons should have animation of actual click, when user clicks a button - bottom part of the button (10px) animates it's height to 0px and whole button moves down that 10px
Click on any existing contact trigger the same scale+opacity animation and open edit form.
Store all data in local storage.
Add drag and drop for reordering of the list, store order in local storage too.
